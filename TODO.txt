LPOP:
    could implement a pointer that points to the list start so u dont have to slice lists 
    when using LPOP with range but this would require me making a new list class might do that at the end of project



Implement serveBlockedClients() to LPUSH and RPUSH and complete serveBlockedClients helper function
